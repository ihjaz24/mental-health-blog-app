         <p class="font1">Mental health is an issue that has gained increasing attention in recent years, and women mental health is an important aspect of that and for good reason. The various roles which a woman plays through their lifespan and the societal pressures and expectations which come along with it play a huge role in the increased occurrence of mental health related conditions in women. The expectation to juggle multiple roles including that of a caregiver, employee and homemaker, while also maintaining a certain appearance or personality is an important contributor and the constant feeling of falling short of them can further add to the cause.

            In addition, women are prone to face challenges related to their reproductive health which in turn can affect their mental health. Hormonal changes during menstruation, pregnancy and post pregnancy, and menopause can affect women’s mental wellbeing and contribute to the development of mental health disorders such as Premenstrual Dysphoric disorder, Post-partum depression, Post-partum psychosis etc. Another important aspect of reproduction which is fertility and the difficulty which women are increasingly facing around it is resulting in increased risk for mental health related conditions.
            
            While mental health issues can affect anyone, women are more likely to experience certain mental health disorders in comparison to men. Illnesses such as depression and anxiety are more common in women. These disorders can affect women of all ages and backgrounds.
            
            When it comes to treatment for mental health disorders, women may face additional barriers. Stigma around mental health issues can prevent women from seeking help, and they may feel that they need to prioritize the needs of others over their own mental health.
            
            When we look at the various options for treatment, there are a number of effective treatment options available for women with mental health disorders which include therapy, medication, lifestyle modifications and self-care techniques such as exercise and meditation etc.<br><br>
            Few tips which one can follow in order to keep their mental health in check:<br>
            1.Regular physical exercise, it can be as simple as brisk walk for 30-40mins per day 4-5 days per week<br>
            2.Getting adequate sleep and following a good sleep hygiene routine for the same is helpful in maintaining one’s mental health<br>
            3.Balanced and nutritious diet, avoiding excessive sugar and caffeine in the diet<br>
            4.Practicing mindfulness and engaging in the activities you enjoy and find interesting<br>
            5.Good social support plays an important role in maintaining your mental health<br>
            It is important for women to prioritize their mental health and seek help when needed in order to perform their diverse roles effectively. It is also important for us as healthcare providers to work towards creating an inclusive and supportive environment for women seeking mental health treatment and the way to do this is by raising awareness at community level by providing the right resources for information and guidance regarding mental health conditions and their treatment.
